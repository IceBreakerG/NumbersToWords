# NumbersToWords
Simple class that converts a number to its grammatical representation (ie. the actual words of the number. Ex: 1784 = One Thousand Seven Hundred Eighty Four).

Note: This is written in C# and .NET Core 2.0

# Usage Instructions
Clone the repository and open the solution in Visual Studio.  Run the project and enter a number (ie. 178).  You will get the output of the number conversion in the console window.

To use this in your own project, simply copy the NumberToWords.cs file into your project and make a reference to the namespace "NumbersToWords".

If you would like to set your output to include dollars and cents (ie. 140.19 = One Hundred Forty Dollars and 19/100), set the includeDollarsAndCents parameter to true.
